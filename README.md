# One Month Rails

This is the Pawpics sample Application for [*One Month Rails*](http://onemonthrails.com)

Pawpics will be a Pinterest style Application consisting mainly of pictures of my dog. The world does not need another social sharing app, especially for canines, therefore do not fear this is for educational purposes only.

This is my first time working with Rails so:
1. Be patient
2. Consider that even simple things will be completely foreign to me
3. Share the love
